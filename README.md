# ⚡ Serverless Astro.js with Google Sheets as a Database + Dynamic Routing! 🚀

📊 **Turn Google Sheets into a lightweight database with dynamic routing in Astro.js!** 
No backend, no traditional CMS—just a simple, free, and serverless way to manage content.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Google Sheets as a Database** – Store and manage content easily.  
✅ **Dynamic Routing** – Auto-generates pages based on your sheet data.  
✅ **Free & Serverless** – No hosting costs, no backend needed.  
✅ **SEO-Friendly** – Static, fast, and optimized for search engines.

## 🚧 Limitations

⚠️ **Google API Quotas** – Too many requests? Google might slow you down.  
⚠️ **Read-Only** – No live edits on your site; update via Sheets.  
⚠️ **Sheet Structure Matters** – Change column names? Break everything. 😅  
⚠️ **Public Data Only** – We use OpenSheets, so your sheet **must** be public. If privacy is a concern, use the official Google API instead.  
⚠️ **Not Ideal for Large Data** – Too many rows? Performance may suffer! This works best for lightweight datasets.

## 🛠️ Setup

### For the repo:

1️⃣ **Edit `sitemap.xml`** – Update it for your site structure.  
2️⃣ **Modify `fetchbooks.js`** – Adjust data fetching as needed.  
3️⃣ **Customize the frontend** – Tweak styles, layout, and content to match your vision.
